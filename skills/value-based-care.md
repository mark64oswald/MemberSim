# Value-Based Care

## Overview

Value-based care (VBC) shifts payment from volume (fee-for-service) to value (quality outcomes and cost efficiency).

## Payment Models

### Pay-for-Performance (P4P)
- FFS base with quality bonuses
- Withhold arrangements
- Low risk for providers

### Shared Savings
- Providers share savings below target cost
- Often one-sided (savings only, no downside)
- ACO model foundation

### Shared Risk
- Two-sided: share savings AND losses
- Greater potential reward
- Requires scale and analytics

### Bundled Payments
- Single payment for episode of care
- Includes all services related to condition
- Provider manages within budget

### Capitation
- Per member per month (PMPM) payment
- Provider assumes full financial risk
- Global capitation: all services
- Professional capitation: physician services only

## Attribution

### Assignment of Members to Providers
Methods:
- **Prospective**: Assigned at start of period
- **Retrospective**: Based on utilization patterns
- **PCP Selection**: Member chooses primary care
- **Plurality**: Provider with most visits/spend

### Attribution Rules
- Minimum visit requirements
- Lookback period
- Specialty exclusions
- Geographic considerations

## Quality Measures

### Common VBC Measures
- HEDIS measures (preventive, chronic care)
- Readmission rates
- ED utilization
- Generic prescribing rate
- Patient satisfaction (CAHPS)

### Measure Weighting
- Quality gate: must meet minimum quality for any shared savings
- Quality multiplier: higher quality = higher savings share

## Financial Targets

### Target Setting
- Historical baseline (trended forward)
- Risk adjustment (HCC-based)
- Regional benchmarks

### Performance Calculation
- Actual vs. expected cost
- Savings/losses = target - actual
- Shared percentage applied (e.g., 50/50)

## Risk Adjustment

### Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC)
- CMS-HCC for Medicare
- HHS-HCC for commercial
- Diagnosis-based risk scoring

### RAF (Risk Adjustment Factor)
- Multiplier based on member acuity
- Higher RAF = higher target (more expected spending)

## Reporting

### Typical Reports
- Monthly/quarterly financial performance
- Quality measure dashboards
- Care gap reports
- Attribution rosters
- Utilization summaries

### Reconciliation
- Annual settlement of shared savings/losses
- Quality adjustment applied
- True-up payments
