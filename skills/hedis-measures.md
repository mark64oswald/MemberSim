# HEDIS Quality Measures

## Overview

HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) is developed by NCQA to measure health plan quality. Used for Star Ratings, accreditation, and value-based contracts.

## Measure Structure

### Denominator
Population eligible for the measure (e.g., women 50-74 for breast cancer screening).

### Numerator
Members who received the appropriate care (e.g., had mammogram).

### Exclusions
Valid reasons to remove from denominator (e.g., bilateral mastectomy).

### Rate
Numerator / (Denominator - Exclusions) × 100

## Key Measure Categories

### Effectiveness of Care

**Preventive Screening:**
- BCS: Breast Cancer Screening (mammogram, women 50-74)
- CCS: Cervical Cancer Screening (Pap test, women 21-64)
- COL: Colorectal Cancer Screening (50-75)

**Diabetes Care (CDC):**

## Care Gaps

A "care gap" exists when a member is in denominator but not in numerator.

### Gap Status
- **Open**: Member needs service
- **Closed**: Member received service (in numerator)
- **Excluded**: Member has valid exclusion

### Gap Closure
Opportunities to close gaps:
- Preventive visit scheduling
- Provider alerts
- Member outreach
- Health coaching

## Star Ratings

CMS Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage (1-5 stars):
- Based on HEDIS measures + CAHPS surveys + HOS + Part D measures
- 5-star plans receive bonus payments
- Quality Bonus Payment (QBP) tied to star level

## Measurement Year

- Calendar year measurement period
- Data collection through hybrid (chart + claims) or administrative (claims only)
- Submission deadline typically June following measurement year
